"\tFamilyWell智能安防系统主要由一个智能网关与各种智能设备组成，以云服务器、移动互联网、RF通信技术为数据链路的载体，实现远程智能终端对居家环境的远程监测与控制，系统支持多种情景模式和灵活的自定义情景执行规则，自动执行各种安防事故应急处理。智能设备目前已经有烟雾报警器、燃气报警器、一氧化碳报警器、水感报警器、门磁探测器、人体移动探测器、紧急呼叫按钮、智能插座和温湿度探测器等。近期，还会不断增加的智能设备有网络摄像头、智能锁、开关面板、插座面板、智能空气净化和电磁水阀等，敬请期待！" = "\tFamilyWell smart security system contains two main parts: Gateway and smart devices. Gateway, a key component of the system, communicates with smart devices using RF communication technology and connects to home Wi-Fi network so as to communicate with Cloud Server. Smart phone and an app via mobile internet store and access records of linked devices from Cloud Server so as to long-ranged monitor and control them. In this way the system allows you use your smart phone as a command center to complement various operations, including creating rules, adding and deleting components, arming and disarming, receiving push notifications when alarms are triggered and other customized operations. Smart devices in the system includes following devices that are selectable based on your needs: smoke alarm, gas alarm, CO detector, water detector, door sensor, passive infrared sensor, emergency button, smart socket, temperature and humidity device and so on. The list of devices in FamilyWellis continuously updating; network camera, door lock, switch panel, socket panel, smart air purification, electromagnetic water valve and others are coming soon!";
